            <h2>AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY...</h2>
            <p>“Almost three years ago I began on a quest to find a new way to extract THC. My path would lead me all the way to Tel Aviv Isreal to the only THC Schedule A Testing facility in the world. There I was introduced to their faculty and witnessed first hand the latest in THC extrcation technology. With no cameras allowed and certainly no direct view of the machines and technology used, I was both impressed and frustrated. How were they accomplishing this? The effects were so powerful. How was I going to replicate this with no prior knowledge of their methods? I then quickly turned ot Denver Colorado where I met a group who were also searching for something similar to my idea. I tried their version and they showed me how they did it. It was unimpressive to say the least. Although I was a step closer to realizing what it was going to take to pull this all off, I needed some help, scientific help. It was then I ended up in the California Valley where I met two men that would change my life forver. A weekend of laughs mixed with what has become the fastest activating THC formula ever made, I now represent DLABS as founder and CEO. We are so proud to be able to release our amazing line of edible and medicinal THC & CDB infused products.”Our focus is always on our customers.
